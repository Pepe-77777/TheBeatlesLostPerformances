        <p>The entire show was recorded, but many scenes were removed due to the director's wrong choice of members, Ringo without a voice in Boys, etc...<br>
          there were many technical problems, so we only have this excerpt which is the only good part of the film.
          <br>We also have a B-Roll in master, but the quality is horrible.</p>
